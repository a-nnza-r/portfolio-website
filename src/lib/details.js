  introduction:
    "I am a Software Engineer graduating from Singapore University of Technology and Design currently on track to graduate with Honours in May 2025, my academic journey is driven by a passion for building scalable systems, solving complex problems, and driving innovation.\n\n To complement my formal education, I have gained hands-on experience in software development and distributed systems. My technical expertise is showcased through impactful projects, including the TunaDB project where my team implemented a database with high write throughput using Go (similar to Facebook's Cassandra), and my internship at Konigle where I gained significant experience in full-stack development. Additionally, I developed an award-winning Android application, demonstrating my proficiency in mobile app development and user-centric design.\n\nI am proficient in Python, Java, Go, and JavaScript, with experience in backend frameworks, distributed systems, and DevOps tools such as Docker. My skill set also includes database management, and a solid foundation in algorithms and data structures.\n\nDriven by a commitment to continuous learning, I actively seek opportunities to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios, aiming to contribute to impactful and robust software solutions.",
