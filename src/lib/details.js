  introduction:
    "I am a Software Engineer, graduating with Honours in May 2025. My passion lies in building scalable systems and solving complex problems.\n\nThrough projects like TunaDB, where my team implemented a high-throughput database in Go (inspired by Facebook's Cassandra), and an internship at Konigle focused on full-stack development, I have gained hands-on experience in distributed systems and backend engineering.\n\nI am proficient in Python, Java, Go, and JavaScript, with skills in backend frameworks, Docker, and database management. My expertise is rooted in strong fundamentals of algorithms and data structures, complemented by a commitment to continuous learning and delivering impactful software solutions.",
